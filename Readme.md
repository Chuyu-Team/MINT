# Mouri's Internal NT API Collections (MINT)

- [简体中文](自述.md)

Mouri's Internal NT API Collections (MINT) was originally called NativeLib or 
ChuyuWindowsInternalAPI. I have changed the name of this project because the 
original name is too long. This project contains the definitions for the 
Windows Internal UserMode API from ntdll.dll, samlib.dll and winsta.dll. This
project is based on a modified fork of https://github.com/processhacker/phnt,
you can browse our fork from https://github.com/Chuyu-Team/phnt.

## The difference from https://github.com/processhacker/phnt

- Single File.
- No kernel mode definitions.
- Compiling using the `/W4 /WX` option is supported.
- No private definition from the https://github.com/processhacker/phnt.
- Optimized for the Windows SDK.
- "Zw*" API is under the management of Windows SDK version macros.

## How to use

Copy MINT.h to your project and directly include it.

```
// If you wonder to use separate namespace, please define the following macro.
#define MINT_USE_SEPARATE_NAMESPACE

#include "MINT.h"
```
